### 🌐 Future GitHub Pages Deployment
- Frontend build ready for static hosting
- Production build: `npm run build` creates `dist/` folder
- Can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service

### 📋 Recent Fixes & Status (Aug 25, 2025)

**✅ HTTP 500 EOFError Resolution:**
- Root Cause: Missing/corrupted ML activation files during CAV training
- Solution: Downloaded 1.1GB of required ML data using `python bin/download_data.py`
- Result: CAV training now works without errors after server restart

**✅ Learn Concept Button Fix:**
- Root Cause: Missing click handler in ProjectCard.vue
- Solution: Added `@click.stop="navigateToProject"` with proper Vue router navigation
- Location: `frontend/src/components/ProjectCard.vue:56`
- Result: "Try Concept" buttons now properly navigate to project snapshots

### 📋 Next Steps
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for web access
- Consider creating public demo instance  
- Continue CAV research and development
