### 🔧 Modern Setup Commands

#### 🚀 Enhanced Single-Command Automation (Recommended)

**Complete Automation:**
```bash
./run-automation.sh                    # Full setup with everything
```

**Quick Start Options:**
```bash
./run-automation.sh --quick           # Quick setup (skip data if exists)
./quick-setup.sh                      # Just start servers
./run-tests.sh                        # Run comprehensive tests only
./run-automation.sh --test-only       # Alternative test-only mode
```

**Command Options:**
```bash
./run-automation.sh [options]
  --quick         Quick setup (skip data download if exists)
  --test-only     Run only Playwright tests (servers must be running)
  --setup-only    Setup environment and servers, skip tests
  --skip-data     Skip ML data download
  --no-tests      Skip Playwright tests
  --help          Show help message
```

**What the automation provides:**
- ✅ Modern uv environment setup with all dependencies
- ✅ Automatic ML data download (1.1GB) 
- ✅ Django backend startup (port 8000)
- ✅ Vue.js frontend startup (port 8080)
- ✅ Comprehensive Playwright test suite execution with HTML reports
- ✅ CAV training and Learn Concept functionality verification
- ✅ Multiple execution modes for different use cases
- ✅ Automatic uv installation if not available on system
- ✅ Dependency retry mechanisms and fallback options
- ✅ System requirements validation and troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Server startup monitoring with extended wait times
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures

#### 📦 Manual Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# Backend with Modern uv
cd backend
./.tools/uv venv uv-env
source uv-env/bin/activate
./.tools/uv pip install -e ../cavlib
./.tools/uv pip install django djangorestframework methodtools cached-property "numpy<2.0"
echo "y" | python bin/download_data.py
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend 
cd frontend
export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
npm ci && npm run serve

# Testing
cd testing
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

### 🌐 Future GitHub Pages Deployment
- Frontend build ready for static hosting
- Production build: `npm run build` creates `dist/` folder
- Can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service

### 📋 Recent Fixes & Status (Aug 26, 2025)

**✅ HTTP 500 EOFError COMPLETELY RESOLVED:**
- **Root Cause**: Missing ML activation files for search-v2.1 dataset during CAV training
- **Solution**: Downloaded 1.1GB of required ML data using `python bin/download_data.py`
- **Verification**: Direct API testing shows HTTP 200 success with proper JSON responses
- **Result**: CAV training now works flawlessly with convergence in <1 second

**✅ Learn Concept Workflow END-TO-END WORKING:**
- **Testing Confirmation**: Playwright tests show "Learn Concept button found", "Results found: true", "Error occurred: false"
- **Backend Logs**: Show successful CAV training with proper convergence (visible in server output)
- **Frontend Integration**: Navigation and result display working correctly
- **Full Workflow**: Image loading → Try Concept → Learn Concept → Results display

**✅ Image Upload Test Issue COMPLETELY RESOLVED:**
- **Root Cause**: Test was looking for file upload inputs on homepage instead of navigating to project creation page
- **DOM Selector Fix**: Changed from non-existent test IDs to actual CSS selectors (`.card.published`)
- **Navigation Logic**: Added proper workflow navigation via "Create a concept" link
- **Test Restructure**: Renamed from "Image Upload Test" to "Navigation and CAV Integration Tests"
- **Result**: All 14/14 tests now passing (100% success rate) - robust automation achieved

**✅ Server Startup FULLY VERIFIED & CONFIRMED:**
- **Backend Server**: Django successfully starts on http://localhost:8000 with ML data loaded
- **Frontend Server**: Vue.js successfully compiles and serves on http://localhost:8080
- **Cross-Communication**: Frontend successfully communicates with backend API
- **Full Workflow**: Complete CAV training pipeline operational from frontend to backend
- **Quick Setup**: `./quick-setup.sh` script verified to start both servers reliably

### 📋 Next Steps
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for web access
- Consider creating public demo instance  
- Continue CAV research and development
