# CAV Studio - Complete Automation Setup ✅

## Project Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The CAV Studio (Mood Board Search) project has been successfully automated with modern tooling and comprehensive testing capabilities.

### 🛠️ What Was Accomplished

#### 1. **Modern Environment Setup**
- ✅ Downloaded fresh project from user `1kaiser/mood-board-search`
- ✅ Installed `uv` package manager locally in project (`backend/.tools/uv`)
- ✅ Created modern `uv` virtual environment (`backend/uv-env/`)
- ✅ Updated `pyproject.toml` with comprehensive dependency management
- ✅ Fixed all dependency issues including NumPy <2.0 compatibility

#### 2. **Backend Environment (Django + ML)**
- ✅ Django 3.2.8 with REST framework
- ✅ ML dependencies: TensorFlow Lite, scikit-learn, scikit-image
- ✅ CAV library installed and working
- ✅ ML activation data downloaded (1.1GB dataset)
- ✅ Database migrations completed
- ✅ Server successfully starts on port 8000

#### 3. **Frontend Environment (Vue.js)**
- ✅ Node.js dependencies installed with npm ci
- ✅ Legacy Node.js compatibility configured
- ✅ Vue.js 2.x framework ready
- ✅ All components and assets in place

#### 4. **Automation Script Created**
- ✅ Comprehensive automation script: `run-automation.sh`
- ✅ 9-step automated process covering everything
- ✅ Automatic dependency installation
- ✅ Server startup and health checks
- ✅ Playwright test execution
- ✅ CAV functionality verification

### 🚀 How to Run Everything

#### Option 1: Full Automation (Recommended)
```bash
# Run complete automation script
./run-automation.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
source uv-env/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 8000

# Frontend setup (in new terminal)
cd frontend
export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
npm run serve

# Tests (in new terminal)
cd testing
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

### 📊 Testing Capabilities

The automation includes comprehensive testing for:

1. **Backend API Testing**
   - Health endpoint verification
   - Projects API functionality
   - Database connectivity

2. **CAV Training Functionality**
   - ML model loading verification
   - Activation data processing
   - Concept learning capabilities

3. **Frontend Integration Testing**
   - Image upload functionality
   - Learn Concept button behavior
   - Navigation and UI components

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete user workflow testing
   - Cross-component integration
   - Real-world usage scenarios
