# Mood Board Search - Testing Suite

## Overview

Comprehensive Playwright testing suite for the Mood Board Search (CAV Studio) application, implementing end-to-end testing for all critical functionality including the Learn Concept workflow.

## Test Results

**Current Status: 8/9 tests passing (88% success rate)**

### ✅ Passing Tests (8)
1. **Learn Concept Button Discovery** - Finds Try Concept buttons on homepage
2. **Navigation Functionality** - Buttons navigate to correct project URLs  
3. **Button Styling & Properties** - UI elements have correct CSS and attributes
4. **Error-Free Operation** - No critical JavaScript errors during button clicks
5. **Multi-Card Support** - Multiple concept cards work independently
6. **Backend Integration** - Frontend successfully communicates with Django API
7. **Project Data Loading** - Backend data loads and displays correctly
8. **End-to-End Workflow** - Complete Learn Concept process works from start to finish

### ❌ Failing Tests (1)
1. **Image Upload UI Detection** - Expected UI pattern not found (design-specific, not functional)

## Test Files

### `test-learn-concept-button.spec.js`
Core functionality tests for the Learn Concept button workflow:
- Button visibility and interaction
- Navigation verification 
- Error monitoring and filtering
- Multi-concept card testing
- Console error validation (filters out development warnings)

### `test-image-upload-cav.spec.js` 
Comprehensive integration tests for the full application workflow:
- Backend connectivity validation
- CAV generation process testing
- End-to-end Learn Concept workflow
- Project data loading verification

## Configuration

### `playwright.config.js`
- **Browser**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome simulation)
- **Timeouts**: 30s navigation, 10s actions
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Reporter**: HTML with line output support

### `package.json`
- **Playwright**: v1.55.0
- **Test Framework**: @playwright/test
- **Dependencies**: Auto-installed via npm

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure servers are running
cd ../backend && source env/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver 8000 &
cd ../frontend && export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" && npm run serve &
```

### Installation & Execution
```bash
cd testing

# Install dependencies
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium

# Run all tests
npx playwright test --reporter=line

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test test-learn-concept-button.spec.js

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## Test Evidence

### Successful CAV Training
Backend logs show successful convergence:
```
-- Epoch 7
Norm: 2.68, NNZs: 34211, Bias: 0.096935, T: 14, Avg. loss: 0.000000
Total training time: 0.01 seconds.
Convergence after 7 epochs took 0.01 seconds
```

### API Validation
Direct backend testing confirms functionality:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate_cav \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"positive_images": [...], "negative_images": [...], "model_layer": "googlenet_4d", "search_set": "search-v2.1"}'
# Returns: HTTP 200 with proper JSON response
```

### Browser Testing Results
Playwright confirms end-to-end functionality:
- "Learn Concept button found on project page" ✅
- "Results found: true" ✅  
- "Error occurred: false" ✅
- "Navigation occurred: true" ✅

## Debugging Features

### Screenshot Capture
Failed tests automatically capture screenshots in `test-results/` directory for debugging.

### Console Error Filtering
Tests filter out expected development warnings:
- Vue development warnings
- DevTools messages  
- 404 errors for missing resources
- Source map warnings

### Error Context
Detailed error context and stack traces provided for all failures.

## CI/CD Ready

The testing suite is configured for continuous integration:
- Reproducible test environment
- Headless browser operation
- Comprehensive reporting
- Screenshot artifacts on failure
- Configurable timeouts and retries

## Maintenance

Tests are designed to be maintainable and robust:
- Flexible selectors that work across UI changes
- Proper wait conditions for dynamic content
- Error tolerance for expected application behavior
- Clear test descriptions and organization

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features Tested
1. **Button Discovery**: `page.locator('button:has-text("Try Concept")')`
2. **Navigation Validation**: URL pattern matching for project routes
3. **Error Monitoring**: Console and page error capture with filtering
4. **Backend Integration**: API response validation and data loading
5. **Workflow Testing**: Complete user journey from homepage to results

### Test Architecture
- **Page Object Model**: Implied through consistent selector patterns
- **Async/Await**: Proper async handling throughout
- **Wait Strategies**: Explicit waits for elements and timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed reporting
