## What is Mood Board Search?

Mood Board Search is an A.I. Experiment that lets you train a computer to recognize visual concepts using mood boards and machine learning. It’s a playful way to explore and analyze image collections using mood boards as your search query.

For this release, we're making Mood Board Search available as a HTML/JS frontend app (“CAVstudio”)  that works with a local Python backend.

## Who is it for?

Artists, photographers, image researchers, curators, educators – really, anyone who wants to work with images in more expressive and subjective ways.

## What is this repository for?

This repository contains two components related to Mood Board Search:

- “CAVstudio”
- “CAVlib”

## How does Mood Board Search work?

![Tech diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1244307/140048774-974b455a-0a29-4e78-a1ed-5a42960f40df.png)

Mood Board Search works by training a model to recognize a visual concept using an open-source ML method called [concept activation vectors (CAVs)]. Once you’ve trained your CAV, you can use it to search image collections to show you the closest matches, according to your CAV. You can review the results, fine-tune the things it likes, and inspect each result to understand what it's drawn to. Once you’re finished training a CAV, you can deploy it into a Python application using only a few lines of code.


CAVstudio works by creating a concept activation vector (CAV) from your training images, and then using it to search a set of images to show you the closest matches according to the CAV. You can review the results, fine tune the things it likes, and inspect each result to understand what it's drawn to.

Once you're happy, you can export the CAV file for use in [CAV Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.nordprojects.cavcam), or use it in your own projects with [CAVlib].

## A closer look at CAVs

<!-- MARK how it works start -->

CAVs are a direction in 'embedding space' - a vector. It works like this: if you take a layer of a neural network ML model and extract all the values in the neurons at that point (the 'activations'), you can treat these values as a point in embedding space. Every different input image is mapped to a different location, with similar images close together, and different images far apart.

<center><small><i>'Embedding space' is a high-dimensional space - perhaps thousands of dimensions. <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">Embedding projector</a> is a visual way to explore embedding spaces, by projecting each point to 3 dimensions using clever mathematical techniques like UMAP and T-SNE.</i></small></center>

---

CAVs can be used as a lightweight way to train neural network ML models to recognise new visual concepts.  By taking existing pretrained models, CAVs can expose hidden understanding of inner layers of the model by finding the direction (a.k.a 'vector') of a concept in the high-dimensional embedding space. This is a simple form of transfer learning that produces surprisingly good results with tiny amounts of training data. We've had success training CAVs using as few as 10-30 images. The resulting CAV is very lightweight - around 250kB - and can be deployed into a Python application using only a few lines of code.

To create a CAV, you need positive and negative training images. Positive images show the concept you're trying to express, and negative ones do not (or even better, show the opposite).

For example, if you were trying to create a CAV to illustrate a concept 'roundness', your positive training images would be pictures of round things, and the negative images would be not-round things, or just random images.

CAVs are created by finding a direction in this high dimensional space that differentiates the positive from the negative training images. You can train (and download) a CAV from Mood Board Search, or train it directly in CAVlib using the cavlib.train_cav function.

Once formed, the CAV can be compared with any new image, by looking at the angle between the CAV and the new image's activations, a technique known as cosine similarity. We call the resulting number the 'CAV score' - in our example, a measure of 'roundness' - as a number from -1 to 1.

## How to use Mood Board Search

This release of Mood Board Search is available as a HTML/JS frontend app (“CAVstudio”) that works with a local Python backend.

To run CAVstudio, you'll need on your machine:
- Python 3.8. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- node v15+. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We used node v15, but newer versions should also work.

### ⚡ Quick Start (Modern uv-Based Automation)

First, clone this repository.

#### 🚀 Automated Setup (Recommended - Single Command)
```bash
# Complete automation with uv package manager
./run-automation.sh
```

This single command will:
- ✅ Set up modern uv environment with all dependencies
- ✅ Download 1.1GB ML activation data automatically  
- ✅ Start Django backend (port 8000) and Vue.js frontend (port 8080)
- ✅ Run comprehensive Playwright test suite
- ✅ Verify all CAV training and concept learning functionality

#### 📦 Manual Setup (Alternative)

**Backend Setup with Modern uv:**
```bash
cd backend
# uv is installed locally in .tools/uv
./.tools/uv venv uv-env
source uv-env/bin/activate
./.tools/uv pip install -e ../cavlib
./.tools/uv pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers methodtools cached-property tqdm requests platformdirs "numpy<2.0"
```

**Frontend Setup:**  
```bash
cd frontend
export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"  # Required for compatibility
npm ci
```

**ML Data Download:**

1. A sample set that contains 2700 photos (.jpgs and .pngs) of everyday things—from household objects to plants and animals to local monuments and landmarks—taken by people from a Google design team. Photos were taken by a phone camera. EXIF data were removed from all images and all images are shared under [the Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Please note: These images were collected specifically to demonstrate the functionality of the Mood Board Search tool. The Mood Board Search tool selects images from this gallery based on a set of inputs. We do not expect people to use the images for any other purpose. This gallery of images was not constructed for the purposes of training machine learning models. Therefore, no scientific tests were conducted on this gallery of images. The Mood Board tool is based on [technology](https://github.com/tensorflow/tcav) developed by Google Researchers (Been Kim and colleagues). See [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11279) for details. This will download 1.1GB of data onto your device, taking around 10-15 mins (depending on your connection & compute speeds).

2. Sample visual concepts by Alex Etchells, Tom Hatton, and Rachel Maggart. The images contained within the visual concepts are made publicly available for use in Mood Board Search (“CAVstudio”) only. The owners of the images retain copyright.

Download the ML data manually:
```bash
cd backend
source uv-env/bin/activate
echo "y" | python bin/download_data.py
```

### 🚀 Running (Modern Commands)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Try Concept" Button Not Working
**Problem:** Button appears but doesn't navigate when clicked.
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** in this version
**Solution:** This issue has been resolved. The button now properly navigates to project snapshots.

#### Frontend Build Errors (NODE_OPTIONS)
**Problem:** Build fails with OpenSSL errors
**Solution:**
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
npm run serve
```

#### NumPy Version Conflicts
**Problem:** HTTP 500 errors from backend
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Requirements now specify `numpy<2.0`
**Solution:** Ensure you use the fixed requirements.txt file

#### Port Conflicts
**Problem:** "Port already in use" errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000  # Backend
lsof -i :8080  # Frontend

# Kill processes if needed
pkill -f "manage.py runserver"
pkill -f "npm run serve"
```

#### Missing CAV Files (404 errors)
**Problem:** Backend logs show 404 errors for .cav files
**Solution:** This is normal for new installations - CAV files are created when you train concepts.

### Verification Commands

Test your setup with these commands:
```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ping_cav_server

# Test frontend
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Run automated tests
cd testing && npx playwright test
```

Explore three preloaded concepts, or create a new concept using images from your computer.

To create a new concept:

1. Gather and upload images that evoke a certain style, mood, or “feel” of an idea. We recommend using 50 square-ratio  images, but we’ve had success using as few as 15 images.
2. Select an image set to search.
3. Train your Concept Activation Vector (CAV) and explore the results to see how well the model expresses your concept.
4. Inspect your results using Focus mode to see which parts of the image match your mood board best – or AI crop mode, to crop in directly to uncover new compositions.
5. You can retrain your CAV as many times as you like by upweighting, downweighting, deleting, or adding new images to your mood board.
6. Once you're happy with how the model expresses your visual concept, you can download your CAV file for use in [CAVcamera], an experimental camera app we made that lets you take photos using CAVs as your real-time guide.
